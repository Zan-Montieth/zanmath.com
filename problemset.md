# Problem Set

Building an extendable data set for math problems would allow for a standardized practice between instruction and assessment where the problems practiced resemble those on the test. 

## Different Extensions Needs

### Assignments 
should have adaptable modes of answering allowing multiple choice for introductory and open response for higher level of rigor. Questions can be presented individually with as much or as little detail as necessary

### Group Practice
would have mostly the same requirements as assignments

### Assessments
Alternative test generation tools can lead to excessive paper use where similar problems have the same prompt printed over and over again where a hand created test often has one heading with different sets of numbers below to consolidate similar questions. 

## Question Structure in The Backend

A generalized concept for the structure further iteration may become apparent as development continues

- subject
  - category
    - skill
      - prompt
      - problem (possibly with images or generated shapes) 
      - answer directions
      - answer type(text input, multiple choice, guided sentence, paragraph)
      - answer 
      - answer tolerances
      - Notes? to track issues?
