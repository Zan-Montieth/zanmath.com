An educational project to improve math education outcomes for students and support teachers

## Project Overview
  
  **Description:** This project will create online tools to aid teachers with classroom instruction both in person and online.  

  **Goal:** To create an online tool for teachers and students to improve math education outcomes. 

  **Importance:** Currently available tools do not meet the needs of both students and teachers. Teachers want tools that match curriculum and content standards. Students want engaging options/

## Objectives and Scope

  **Objectives:** 
  - Provide teachers with useful data on student performance.
  - Provide students with guided lessons that aid in learning.
  - Improve student motivation toward completion of assignments. 
  
  **Scope:** 
  - MVP: create one testable lessons or assessment to gain feedback and determine project viability. 

## Requirements

  Technical Requirements: 
  - Must be accessible from typical secured school networks.
  - Must meet regulatory requirements for the use of student data. 
  
  Human Resources: 
  - Development team with the technical expertise to design and implement the product.
  - Educational partners to align activities and provide material. 
  - Product testers, a diverse group of product testers to determine iterative improvements and audience appropriateness
  
  Other Resources:
  ==under research== 

## Stakeholders

  Primary Stakeholders: Teachers, and Students
  
  Secondary Stakeholders: Schoolboards and Parents, 

## Timeline and Milestones

  ==Under Consideration==

## Risk Assessment

1. IP Infringements

  Conduct Thorough Research on Existing IP: Before developing, research similar products and check for existing copyrights, patents, or trademarks. Document this research as part of your due diligence.
  Use Open-Source and Licensed Resources Properly: With a preference toawrds open-source, Creative Commons-licensed. Appropriately licensed materials may be used where necessary, and credit any sources in accordance with licensing terms.
  Consider copyrighting or trademarks where appropriate to protect.

2. Security Issues, Especially with Student Data

  Data Privacy and Security Policy: Develop a clear data privacy policy in line with applicable regulations (such as FERPA for the U.S.) and ensure it's accessible to all stakeholders.
  Data Minimization: Only collect the data that is absolutely necessary for the project. Avoid collecting sensitive information wherever possible.
  Secure Storage and Transmission: Encrypt data both at rest and in transit. Use secure databases, restrict access to only those who need it, and avoid storing data on personal or unsecured devices.
  Access Control: Implement role-based access, requiring secure authentication for anyone who accesses student data, and regularly review access permissions.
  Regular Security Audits: Conduct periodic security audits of your system, looking for vulnerabilities or areas where data could be exposed. Use third-party tools or, if possible, an external audit service.
  Incident Response Plan: Have a clear plan in case of a security breach, including steps for notification, containment, and resolution.

3. Ethical Practices

  Establish Ethical Guidelines: Define clear ethical standards for the project. For example, ensure that student participation is voluntary, any data collected is anonymized where possible, and content is respectful and inclusive.
  Transparent Communication: Clearly communicate the project’s purpose, how it impacts students, and how their data or participation will be used. Obtain informed consent if student data is collected.
  Regular Ethical Reviews: Periodically review the project to ensure it continues to meet ethical standards, especially as it evolves. Create a process for stakeholders (students, parents, staff) to voice concerns.
  Bias Awareness and Mitigation: Regularly evaluate any algorithms, content, or processes for bias. Incorporate diverse perspectives during development and review.

## Budget

  Expected Epenses:
  1. URL
  2. Hosting

## Evaluation and Metrics of Success

  Success Criteria: Teacher feedback of a useful and novel software, paired with student feedback of an experience preferable to alternatives
  Evaluation Plan: Responses will either be gathered natively through the developed app, or externally using tools such as google forms

## Next Steps and Action Items

  ==Algebra or Geometry ==
  - I currently use a wide set of software in the classroom that does not currently meet my needs. -The work types can be broken down into group activities, individual homework practice, individual Quizzing, and individual testing
  - The envisioned project will have a question set exists in the backend that can be plugged in and extended by front ends for the different use cases. Question categories should allow for a diverse set of questions, either manually entered or dynamically coded. 
  - An issue with current solutions is limited answer type options, having options for multiple choice or fill-in-the-blank could lead to deeper learning. (Duolingo uses multiple choice to introduce concepts through exploration then moves to typed responses)

  Listed in order of simplest to most complicated.
  - Testing/ quizzes there is a lot of value in creating content templates that will create and generate similar questions with different answers to reduce student teaching. Creating just this tool with the option to print, is I think a viable stand-alone product. Options for printed multiple choice or answer boxes would both make recreating tests for new school years or retakes much easier. Online testing options are slightly more difficult. However, from my own experience implementing time limits, copy-paste protections, and start passwords can go a long way toward creating secure online tests.
  - Individual homework, should have some level of progressive difficulty either set by a teacher or set up by us. Current homework options are mostly bland pages with simple text on them. Any level of gamification and design could improve this dreary state of affairs. Virtual rewards, streak counters, daily quests, all of these could be useful. Proper games would be incredible but massively increase the scope. Simple games like tower defense, cookie clickers, or any other simple 2d genre with lessons plugged in I think make it more interesting. ==Exsisting Examples Available For Reference== The other option of a year-long goal on which progress is made I think is highly intriguing. The class working on a rocket launch simulation. A deep sea exploration mission where things go wrong. A whole different document could be made for homework game ideas
  - Group practice would have students working on their own devices and have a teacher portal to monitor or display group stats. In a simple form, this looks like a clicker question with student responses. Having open response options here improves beyond what my own market research has found. Including things like jeopardy-style templates extends this to what I think is a higher level of interest. Going further would be creating class games where an example would be all students are being asked questions if they get it correct they get points they get it wrong they lose points. And adding variety to this with things like swapping points, shields, modifiers, and powerups. 

  By creating an ecosystem that can share the underlying math problems for practice it could fully replace textbook practice activities and provide teachers with activities and assessments matched up to specific math skills. 

  Once the initial project has been set creating a portal that allows teachers to input their own questions could help grow the content library. I think there is immense value is specific sets tailored to curriculum’s. Having a partner program where teachers can get paid or free access or some kickback when they contribute high-quality sets I think could both be a great way to grow the content library and also grow the user base as teachers spread the word about the platform.
