An educational project to improve math education outcomes for students and support teachers

## Project Overview
  
  **Description:** This project will create online tools to aid teachers with classroom instruction both in person and online.  

  **Goal:** To create an online tool for teachers and students to improve math education outcomes. 

  **Importance:** Currently available tools do not meet the needs of both students and teachers. Teachers want tools that match curriculum and content standards. Students want engaging options/

## Objectives and Scope

  **Objectives:** 
  - Provide teachers with useful data on student performance.
  - Provide students with guided lessons that aid in learning.
  - Improve student motivation toward completion of assignments. 
  
  **Scope:** 
  - MVP: create one testable lessons to gain feedback and determine project viability. 

## Requirements

  Technical Requirements: 
  - Must be accessible from typical secured school networks.
  - Must meet regulatory requirements for the use of student data. 
  
  Human Resources: 
  - Development team with the technical expertise to design and implement the product.
  - Educational partners to align activities and provide material. 
  - Product testers, a diverse group of product testers to determine iterative improvements and audience appropriateness
  
  Other Resources:
  ==under research==
